#Sales-Dashboard
This is my first MeriSKILL internship project.

##Introduction

In this project, I will dive into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights. I will explore sales trends over time, identify the best-selling
products, calculate revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins, and create visualizations to present your findings effectively.

##Purpose
To analyze sales data to identify trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics for business decision-making.
